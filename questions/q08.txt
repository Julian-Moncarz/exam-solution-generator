Question 8: Inequalities and Limits involving ln(x)

(a) Given the functions f(x) = x - 1 - ln(x) and g(x) = ln(x) - 1 + 1/x, prove that the inequalities:
    1 - 1/x < ln(x) < x - 1
are valid for x > 0, x != 1. What happens if x = 1?
Hint: Consider the signs of f' and g'.

(b) Prove that lim_{x->0} ln(1+x)/x = 1 two ways:
    (i) using the definition of the derivative of ln(x)
    (ii) using part (a)
