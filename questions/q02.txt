Question 2: Derivatives and Antiderivatives

Give the derivatives and antiderivatives of each of the following, where c > 0 is a constant:

(a) c^(2x)

(b) x^(2c)

(c) sin(cx)

(d) x * ln(cx^2)

(e) e^(cx)

Hint: you may find it useful to prove, then use, the fact that an antiderivative of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x.
