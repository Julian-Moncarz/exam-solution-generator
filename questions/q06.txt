Question 6: Volumes of Revolution

Consider the region defined by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2 - x^2. Provide a sketch of the region and find (but do NOT solve) integrals representing the following:

(a) The volume of rotation about the x-axis using the washer method.

(b) The volume of rotation about the x-axis using the shell method.

(c) The volume of rotation about the line x = 1 using the washer method.

(d) The volume of rotation about the line x = 1 using the shell method.
