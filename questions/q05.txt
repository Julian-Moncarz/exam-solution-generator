Question 5: Curve Sketching

For the function f(x) = 1/x^2 - 1/(x-2)^2:

(i) Determine the domain of f, the x and y intercepts, and identify any symmetry.

(ii) Find the intervals in which f increases or decreases.

(iii) Find the extreme values.

(iv) Determine the concavity of the graph.

(v) Sketch the graph specifying the points of inflection, asymptotes and vertical tangents, if any.
