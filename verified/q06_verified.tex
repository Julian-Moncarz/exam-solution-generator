\section*{Question 6: Volumes of Revolution}

Consider the region defined by the curves $y = x^2$ and $y = 2 - x^2$.

\subsection*{Sketch of the Region}

First, we find the intersection points by setting $x^2 = 2 - x^2$:
\[2x^2 = 2 \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = \pm 1\]

At $x = \pm 1$, we have $y = 1$. So the curves intersect at $(-1, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$.

The region is bounded above by $y = 2 - x^2$ (downward parabola with vertex at $(0,2)$) and below by $y = x^2$ (upward parabola with vertex at origin).

\subsection*{Part (a): Volume about the $x$-axis using the washer method}

When rotating about the $x$-axis, we integrate with respect to $x$. At each $x \in [-1, 1]$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Outer radius: $R(x) = 2 - x^2$ (the farther curve from the $x$-axis)
    \item Inner radius: $r(x) = x^2$ (the closer curve to the $x$-axis)
\end{itemize}

The washer method gives:
\[
\boxed{V = \pi \int_{-1}^{1} \left[(2-x^2)^2 - (x^2)^2\right] dx}
\]

\subsection*{Part (b): Volume about the $x$-axis using the shell method}

For the shell method about the $x$-axis, we integrate with respect to $y$. We need to express $x$ in terms of $y$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item From $y = x^2$: $x = \sqrt{y}$ (for $x \geq 0$)
    \item From $y = 2 - x^2$: $x = \sqrt{2-y}$ (for $x \geq 0$)
\end{itemize}

For $y \in [0, 1]$: the right boundary is $x = \sqrt{2-y}$ and left boundary is $x = \sqrt{y}$.

For $y \in [1, 2]$: both boundaries come from $y = 2-x^2$, giving $x = \pm\sqrt{2-y}$.

Each shell at height $y$ has:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Radius: $y$
    \item Height (horizontal extent): depends on the interval
\end{itemize}

For $y \in [0,1]$: shell height $= 2(\sqrt{2-y} - \sqrt{y})$ (by symmetry about $y$-axis)

For $y \in [1,2]$: shell height $= 2\sqrt{2-y}$

\[
\boxed{V = 2\pi \int_{0}^{1} y \cdot 2(\sqrt{2-y} - \sqrt{y})\, dy + 2\pi \int_{1}^{2} y \cdot 2\sqrt{2-y}\, dy}
\]

\subsection*{Part (c): Volume about the line $x = 1$ using the washer method}

For rotation about $x = 1$, we integrate with respect to $y$. By symmetry of the original region about the $y$-axis, we focus on how the curves relate to $x = 1$.

For $y \in [0, 1]$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item From $y = x^2$: $x = \pm\sqrt{y}$
    \item From $y = 2-x^2$: $x = \pm\sqrt{2-y}$
    \item Outer radius (from $x=1$): $R(y) = 1 - (-\sqrt{2-y}) = 1 + \sqrt{2-y}$
    \item Inner radius (from $x=1$): $r(y) = 1 - (-\sqrt{y}) = 1 + \sqrt{y}$
\end{itemize}

For $y \in [1, 2]$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only $y = 2-x^2$ bounds the region
    \item Outer radius: $R(y) = 1 + \sqrt{2-y}$
    \item Inner radius: $r(y) = 1 - \sqrt{2-y}$
\end{itemize}

\[
\boxed{V = \pi\int_0^1 \left[(1+\sqrt{2-y})^2 - (1+\sqrt{y})^2\right] dy + \pi\int_1^2 \left[(1+\sqrt{2-y})^2 - (1-\sqrt{2-y})^2\right] dy}
\]

\subsection*{Part (d): Volume about the line $x = 1$ using the shell method}

For the shell method about $x = 1$, we integrate with respect to $x$. Each vertical shell at position $x$ has:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Radius: $|1 - x|$
    \item Height: $(2-x^2) - x^2 = 2 - 2x^2$
\end{itemize}

For $x \in [-1, 1]$, the distance from $x$ to the line $x = 1$ is $1 - x$ (which is positive for all $x$ in this interval).

\[
\boxed{V = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1} (1-x)(2-2x^2)\, dx}
\]

Or equivalently:
\[
\boxed{V = 4\pi \int_{-1}^{1} (1-x)(1-x^2)\, dx}
\]
```
